# hello-world
My first repository

I used to build websites on Dreamweaver, and then on Wordpress. It's been a few years. Now I get to learn all the stuff I was intimidated by back then. I always just copied code from sites that had good ideas and prayed that it would work (and not break my site!), but I had no idea what I was doing. Okay, not NO idea--but I knew just enough to be dangerous...and sometimes profitable.
